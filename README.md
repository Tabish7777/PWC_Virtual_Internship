# TASK 1

I'm excited to share a significant milestone in my journey – my first dashboard created during the PWC virtual internship! 🚀📊 Focused on enhancing call center operations, this dashboard spotlights the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that drive success for both the call center and its diligent agents. 📞🏆
The process behind this dashboard's creation involved several key steps:

1 Data Refinement: Leveraging the power of PowerQuery, I meticulously transformed and cleaned the data. This groundwork was pivotal in ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the insights we'd uncover. 

2️ Diving into DAX: By harnessing DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), I engineered calculated measures and columns that unearthed valuable insights into the call center's performance. 📈 These measures served as the compass guiding us toward informed decisions and continuous improvement.

3️ Visual Exploration: The dashboard truly came to life through an array of visually engaging components – diverse visuals, slicers, and filters. 🖼️ These elements enabled us to immerse ourselves in the data, extract multifaceted insights, and tailor strategies for greater efficiency.
